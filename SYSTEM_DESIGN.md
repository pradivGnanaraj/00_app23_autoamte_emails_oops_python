**System Design: Email News Sender**

The "Email News Sender" project is designed to automate the process of sending personalized news updates to recipients via email. It utilizes external APIs, data manipulation, and email automation to provide a seamless experience. Here is the system design of the project:

**1. Components:**

- **Python Script:** The core of the project, responsible for fetching news articles, sending emails, and scheduling tasks.
- **News API:** External API used to retrieve news articles based on specified interests and date range.
- **Yagmail:** Python library used to send emails with attachments.
- **Excel Spreadsheet (people.xlsx):** Stores recipient information such as name, email, and interests.

**2. Workflow:**

1. **Configuration:** Configure the News API key and Gmail credentials within the script. Provide the recipient information in the `people.xlsx` spreadsheet.

2. **Fetching News:**
   - The script initiates by checking the current time.
   - If the time matches the scheduled time (e.g., 13:28), the script proceeds.
   - Reads recipient data from the `people.xlsx` spreadsheet.
   - For each recipient, it fetches news articles based on their specified interests and date range using the News API.

3. **Email Generation:**
   - For each recipient, it constructs an email containing news articles.
   - Utilizes Yagmail to send personalized emails to recipients.
   - Formats the email body with news article titles and URLs.

4. **Automation:**
   - The script continuously runs in a loop with a delay of 60 seconds between iterations.
   - It checks the current time and compares it to the scheduled time.
   - If the scheduled time is reached, the script sends personalized news emails to recipients.
   - The loop continues to run and check the time for subsequent iterations.

**3. Benefits and Highlights:**

- **API Interaction:** Demonstrates the integration and interaction with external APIs (News API).
- **Data Manipulation:** Shows proficiency in working with Excel spreadsheets to manage recipient data.
- **Email Automation:** Illustrates automation skills by sending emails at scheduled times.
- **Personalization:** Highlights personalized content delivery to recipients based on their interests.
- **Project Modularity:** Utilizes modular functions and libraries for efficient code organization.
- **Documentation:** Offers a detailed README.md guide for setup, configuration, and usage.

**4. Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Yagmail (Python library for email)
- News API
- Excel (for recipient data storage)

**5. Future Enhancements:**

- Implement error handling for API requests and email sending.
- Enhance the user interface for configuring interests and recipients.
- Explore additional sources for news articles.
- Provide a web-based interface for recipient data management and configuration.

The "Email News Sender" project showcases your ability to create a practical and automated solution that leverages external APIs, data storage, and email automation. The system design demonstrates your skills in software architecture, integration, and user-centric features.
